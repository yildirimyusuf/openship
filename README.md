## Quick Start

```bash
npm i -g openship
openship init
```

That's it. Or, if you prefer Docker:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/oblien/openship.git && cd openship
cp .env.example .env
docker compose up -d
```

Or download the desktop app from [openship.io](https://openship.io).

## What It Does

Point it at a repo. Openship detects your stack, builds it, configures everything, and ships it — zero config files, zero pipelines, zero YAML.

Databases, domains, SSL, CDN, mail, backups — all managed from one place.

Works with **Openship Cloud** (managed) or **any Linux server** you own. Solo devs shipping side projects and teams running production use the same tool.

## Deploy Anywhere

- **Openship Cloud** — managed, auto-scaling, zero setup
- **Any VPS** — Hetzner, DigitalOcean, Linode, OVH, and the rest
- **Dedicated servers** — bare metal, colo, homelab
- **Multi-server** — spread workloads across machines

Same interface regardless of where you deploy.

---

## Three Interfaces

- **Desktop app** — full GUI, real-time logs, one-click everything.
- **Web dashboard** — the same UI in the browser, built for teams.
- **CLI** — scriptable and CI-friendly.

A **REST API** and **MCP** (AI agent protocol) round it out for automation and tooling integration. Full command and API reference at [openship.io/docs](https://openship.io/docs).

## Status

Production-ready core, actively developed.

**Coming next:** multi-node clusters, load-balancing UI, private networking, advanced monitoring, and visual CI/CD pipelines.

/**
 * Pipeline shape for "a thing the deploy machinery ships."
 *
 * Two flavors travel through the same pipeline, discriminated by `kind`:
 *
 *   - "compose"  - a docker-compose service backed by an image or a
 *                  Dockerfile. Same fields as the YAML - see `ComposeService`.
 *   - "monorepo" - a sub-app inside a workspace. Source-built; carries its
 *                  own install / build / start commands, framework, root dir.
 *
 * The parser in `compose-parser.ts` ONLY produces compose rows - the
 * monorepo branch is populated by `projectServicesToDeployableServices` (in
 * compose/project-services.ts) when projecting `service` table rows out for
 * the pipeline.
 *
 * Why the split: docker-compose.yml has no concept of install/build/start
 * commands or framework detection. Polluting `ComposeService` with those
 * fields gave every reader the impression that a YAML row could carry
 * them. Now the parser type is strict and only this wider type carries
 * the source-built fields.

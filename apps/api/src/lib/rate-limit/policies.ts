/**
 * Named rate-limit policies — the public surface of the rate-limit
 * module from a route's perspective.
 *
 * Add a route's rate-limit by name in `secureRouter`:
 *
 *   secureRouter.post("/auth/sign-in", { public: true, rateLimit: "auth-tight" }, ...)
 *   secureRouter.get("/projects",      { tag: "project:list", rateLimit: "read-authed" }, ...)
 *
 * Adding a policy:
 *   1. Add the entry below.
 *   2. Add the policy id to PolicyId.
 *   3. Document the use case in the description.
 *
 * Limits are deliberately conservative — easier to raise on operator
 * feedback than to retroactively tighten after an incident.

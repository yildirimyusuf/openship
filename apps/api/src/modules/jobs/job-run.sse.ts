/**
 * Live channel for a custom job RUN — streams each output line + the terminal
 * outcome, keyed by job_run id. Built on the shared run-sse bus. The DB row is
 * the source of truth (final `output` is stored on finish); this only amplifies
 * a run in progress, so a client that connects late still gets a terminal
 * snapshot.

/**
 * Backup-run SSE channel — mirrors the deployment session-manager pattern.
 *
 * Each run gets a topic keyed by runId. Subscribers receive every FSM
 * transition + interim progress events; when the run reaches a terminal
 * state, all subscribers get a final event and the channel closes.
 *
 * Survives dashboard refresh:
 *   - The `backup_run` DB row is the source of truth. SSE amplifies it.
 *   - On (re)connect, the route handler first sends a `snapshot` event
 *     with the current DB row, then attaches as a live subscriber for
 *     subsequent events.
 *   - If the run already finished by the time the client reconnects,
 *     the snapshot event has terminal status and the stream closes
 *     cleanly.

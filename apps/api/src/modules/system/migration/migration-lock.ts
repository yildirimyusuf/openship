/**
 * Transactional quiesce for team-mode migrations.
 *
 * Every migration entry point (start, start-cloud, start-tunnel, switch-back)
 * wraps its work in withMigrationLock so the local instance refuses
 * mutations and pauses background workers during the cutover window.
 *
 * Why this exists:
 *   The cutover takes 30-90s — long enough for a teammate's deploy job to
 *   land in BullMQ, or for the operator to click "save" on a settings
 *   form, AFTER the dump was taken but BEFORE the remote takes over.
 *   Without quiesce those writes either silently disappear (data loss)
 *   or land in a DB that's no longer authoritative (data divergence).
 *
 * Acquire is a compare-and-swap on instance_settings.migration_in_progress.
 * Two operators clicking Migrate at the same moment will see exactly one
 * succeed and the other get MigrationAlreadyInProgressError (409).
 *
 * Stale-lock recovery: if migration_started_at is older than 10 minutes,
 * the next acquire attempt steals the lock — protects against a previous
 * migration process that crashed mid-flight and left the flag set.
 *
 * The finally block ALWAYS releases. On success the dashboard switches
 * to the MigratedLauncher anyway; on failure the operator can retry.
 * Workers always resume — on Path C (tunnel) the local API stays live
 * and needs them, on Paths A/B teamMode flips so the launcher takes
 * over before any worker would actually do anything.

/**
 * Wrap a migration body in the quiesce protocol.

 * Order of operations:
 *   1. Compare-and-swap acquire — throw if another migration is live.
 *   2. Pause the job runner so background workers stop picking new jobs.
 *      (In-flight jobs finish — pause is graceful, not abrupt.)
 *   3. Run the body.
 *   4. ALWAYS resume workers and release the lock (finally), so a
 *      partial failure can't leave the operator permanently locked out.
 *
 * Throws MigrationAlreadyInProgressError if the lock can't be obtained.
 * Re-throws whatever the body throws.
 *
 * NOTE on the pause/resume feature-check below:
 *   The current JobRunner interface (apps/api/src/lib/job-runner/types.ts)
 *   does not expose pause/resume — backup jobs are the only workload it
 *   manages and they're rare enough that mid-migration interference is
 *   unlikely. We still feature-check pauseAll/pause and resumeAll/resume
 *   at runtime so a future runner extension automatically gets
 *   quiesced without touching this file, and so that today's no-op
 *   degrades gracefully (the mutation-guard middleware is the real
 *   defense — this is belt-and-braces).

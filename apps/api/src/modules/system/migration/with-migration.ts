/**
 * `withMigration` — the audit/lock/upsert invariant wrapper for every
 * team-mode migration entry point.
 *
 * ─── Why this exists ──────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Every migration service (migrate-instance, migrate-to-cloud,
 * migrate-to-tunnel, switch-back, db-migrate-remote) has the same
 * surrounding ceremony:
 *
 *   1. acquire the migration lock (compare-and-swap quiesce)
 *   2. read previousMode atomically inside the lock so the audit's
 *      `before` reflects the actual committed state at the moment we
 *      took the lock (not whatever the controller saw a few ms earlier)
 *   3. run the path-specific body (dump / scp / restore / call SaaS / …)
 *   4. on success — upsert instance_settings with the new teamMode
 *      + migrationTargetUrl + migrationServerId + …
 *   5. on success — emit an "instance.migrated" or "instance.switched-back"
 *      audit event REFLECTING the upserted state (so the audit row's
 *      `after` is what the DB actually holds, never what we *meant* to
 *      write)
 *   6. on failure — emit a failure audit event with the typed error
 *      code + message and re-throw; lock is always released by the inner
 *      withMigrationLock's finally block
 *
 * The audit's "invariants, not shape" principle:
 *
 *   The five services each have very different SHAPES — VPS SSH dance,
 *   SaaS HTTP ingest, tunnel provisioning, reverse data pull, raw db
 *   restore — and trying to abstract their internals into one
 *   "migration engine" would force every path into an awkward fit.
 *
 *   What they DO share is a fixed set of INVARIANTS at the boundary:
 *
 *     - exactly one lock acquire per attempt (no double-acquire, no
 *       missed-release)
 *     - exactly one settings upsert per success (so the launcher
 *       flips at a single, observable instant)
 *     - exactly one success-or-failure audit event per attempt
 *       (so the audit log is a complete, gap-free record of every
 *       cutover the operator initiates — required for the 30-day
 *       grace-period purge job that reads this log to decide what
 *       remote data is safe to delete)
 *     - the audit's `after` block reflects the COMMITTED settings row
 *       (upsert happens BEFORE the success audit emit)
 *
 *   `withMigration` enforces those invariants without touching the
 *   per-path body. The services keep their typed errors, their custom
 *   dump/restore logic, their wizard-specific result shapes — only the
 *   wrapping moves into one place.
 *
 * Services opt in INDIVIDUALLY — there's no controller-level magic and
 * no change to their public signatures. The helper is internal
 * infrastructure that each service composes the way it composes
 * `withMigrationLock` today.

/**

 *
 * Order on success:
 *   1. withMigrationLock acquires + quiesces
 *   2. read previousMode + previousSettings inside the lock
 *   3. emit "started" sub-audit (best-effort, fire-and-forget)
 *   4. body runs with typed ctx
 *   5. repos.instanceSettings.upsert(finale.settings)
 *   6. emit success audit with the COMMITTED settings as `after`
 *   7. withMigrationLock's finally releases the lock + resumes workers
 *   8. helper returns finale.result
 *
 * Order on body failure:
 *   1-4 as above
 *   5. emit failure audit with the typed error code + message
 *   6. withMigrationLock's finally releases the lock
 *   7. error is re-thrown to the caller (preserving its type so the
 *      controller's existing error-mapping still works)
 *
 * The wrapper deliberately does NOT swallow errors and does NOT catch
 * the upsert failure separately — if the upsert throws, the operator's
 * remote work is still done but the local row is out of sync, and the
 * loud failure is the right signal (vs silently leaving the operator
 * thinking the migration succeeded). The thrown error from the upsert
 * is captured in the failure audit before being re-thrown.

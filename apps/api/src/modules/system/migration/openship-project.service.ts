 * fixed config (operator can't edit), deterministic slug, reconcile on
 * every deploy so a code change ships clean.
 *
 * The deploy pipeline reads `localPath` to stream the dist to the
 * target server, runs `installCommand`, then `startCommand`. The
 * release dist is laid out so install is the only step that needs to
 * happen on the target (no build — dist is pre-built).

 * be written separately):
 *
 *   release-dist/
 *     package.json        ← bundles api + dashboard runtime deps
 *     api/                ← API source (bun runs TS directly)
 *     dashboard/          ← pre-built Next standalone output
 *     start.ts            ← orchestrator: boots api + serves dashboard
 *
 * installCommand: `bun install --production --frozen-lockfile` —
 *                 frozen-lockfile fails if the dist's lock drifts from
 *                 its package.json (caught a real bug in webmail when
 *                 0.3.4 silently resolved to 0.4.2 on the target).
 * buildCommand:   empty — dist is pre-built, target does no build work.
 * startCommand:   bun runs the release orchestrator that boots api +
 *                 dashboard as a single process under one supervisor.

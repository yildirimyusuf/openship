/**
 * Reverse migration: team_* → single_user.
 *
 * Pulls the remote's data back into this local instance, restores it,
 * flips teamMode. Bidirectional with the forward migration — closes
 * the data-direction loop.
 *
 * Path A (`self_hosted_remote`): SSH back to the operator's VPS using
 *   `migrationServerId` stashed at forward-migration time. Generate a
 *   fresh dump on the remote via `db:dump`, SCP it back, restore.
 *
 * Path B (`cloud_hosted`): call `cloudClient.exportSubgraph(orgScope)`
 *   against the SaaS — it returns the dump scoped to the operator's
 *   org. Restore locally.
 *
 * Path C (`tunneled`): no data move on the forward path, so switch-back
 *   is a teardown of the Oblien tunnel + bookkeeping flip. abandonRemote
 *   is irrelevant here.
 *
 * `abandonRemote: true` skips the sync on Paths A/B — operator flips
 *   teamMode and keeps whatever's currently in their local DB. Useful
 *   when the remote is dead, unreachable, or the operator doesn't want
 *   to overwrite local changes made post-migration.
 *
 * Hard contract regardless of path:
 *   - Calling against `teamMode === "single_user"` is a no-op + 409.
 *   - Remote data is left intact (operator can re-migrate, manually
 *     export, or wait for the 30-day grace-period purge).
 *   - The audit log captures the operator's intent so a future
 *     purge job knows which migration record to act on.
 *
 * Encrypted columns are stripped on the dump side (both VPS and
 * cloud paths) — operator re-links cloud/clone-tokens/etc. on the
 * local host. The wizard surfaces the stripped fields list from the
 * dump's `strippedEncryptedFields` array.
 *
 * Lock acquisition, atomic previousMode read, the single
 * instance_settings upsert, and the success/failure audit events are
 * all owned by `withMigration` — this body only does the per-path
 * data movement and returns the settings patch + result.

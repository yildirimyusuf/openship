/**
 * @module clone-auth
 *
 * Thin adapter over the unified token dispatcher in `github.token.ts` for
 * the deploy pipeline. The dispatcher (`tokenFor(userId, purpose, ctx)`)
 * already encodes the full priority chain; this file only translates the
 * deploy-specific `buildStrategy` discriminator into a `purpose`:
 *
 *   - buildStrategy="local"  → tokenFor(..., "local")
 *   - buildStrategy="server" → requireTokenFor(..., "remote")
 *
 * gh CLI tokens are never returned for "remote" — that policy lives in
 * `tokenFor("remote", ...)` and the rejection happens before this
 * function ever sees a token.
 *
 * Token priority (single source of truth — see github.token.ts):
 *   - purpose: "local"  → project > user-pat > gh CLI > App > OAuth
 *   - purpose: "remote" → project > user-pat > App > REFUSE (no gh CLI)

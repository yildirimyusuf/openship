/**
 * Single source of truth for the CLONE decision: where the repo gets cloned and
 * what credential that clone needs.
 *
 * This was previously derived independently in two places — the build pipeline
 * (`cloneOnServer` + the git-token purpose) and preflight (`dockerClonesOnServer`
 * + the remote-clone credential checks). Because the same decision was computed
 * from slightly different expressions, they drifted: preflight would pass a
 * config the pipeline then rejected (e.g. an api-host clone that preflight knew
 * was local, but the pipeline demanded a remote App/PAT token for). Both callers
 * now go through `resolveClonePlan`, so preflight verifies exactly what the
 * pipeline will do.
 *
 * The "credential actually available? → fall back to api-host" adjustment stays
 * in the pipeline (`effectiveCloneOnServer`) because it depends on the resolved
 * token, which is runtime state, not config.

/**
 * Project service pipeline - orchestrates the full build/deploy lifecycle for
 * projects with child services. Compose is one importer for those services.
 *
 * This is the service equivalent of the single-app pipeline that lives
 * in build.service.ts. It coordinates:
 *   1. Per-service image builds  (compose/build.service)
 *   2. Multi-container deployment (compose/deploy.service)
 *   3. Lifecycle hooks            (shared deployment-lifecycle)
 *
 * Called from build.service.ts when the project has saved services or a deploy
 * request includes parsed compose services.

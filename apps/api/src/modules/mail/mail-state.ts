 * no stale "step 9 complete" rows in openship's DB to confuse the next
 * install attempt. Same model as Terraform's remote state on the resource
 * being managed, or Ansible facts living on the host.
 *
 * The file is one JSON object at a fixed path. We never lock - there's at
 * most one install per server at a time, enforced by the controller's
 * in-memory `activeSession` flag.
 *
 * Logs are persisted here as a capped ring buffer so a page refresh
 * during/after an install can rehydrate the live log panel instead of
 * showing "logs will stream once setup starts". The cap is generous
 * enough for normal installs but bounded to keep the state file small
 * (SSH-read on every getStatus).

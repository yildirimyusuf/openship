/**
 * Refuses mutation requests (POST/PATCH/PUT/DELETE) while a team-mode
 * migration is in flight on this instance. Reads the lock from
 * instance_settings.migration_in_progress, set by withMigrationLock.
 *
 * Self-hosted only. The SaaS side (CLOUD_MODE=true) is the *destination*
 * of migrations — nothing ever calls withMigrationLock there, so the
 * flag would always be false. Short-circuiting at module load skips the
 * per-mutation DB read on cloud instances entirely.
 *
 * Exemptions during the window:
 *   - Anything under /api/system/migration/ (operator must be able to
 *     finish, abort, or run the next step of the wizard)
 *   - Anything under /api/auth/ (session refresh / re-auth must still
 *     work; auth itself is read-mostly and the routes that DO mutate
 *     state — invite, accept — are not catastrophic to delay)
 *   - GET / HEAD / OPTIONS (read-only, safe by definition)
 *
 * Response: 503 with code "MIGRATION_IN_PROGRESS". Dashboard treats
 * this as "show in-progress launcher" if it sees it during a refresh.
 *
 * Stale-lock recovery happens in withMigrationLock's tryAcquireLock,
 * not here — this middleware just reflects the current flag. Worst
 * case: an orphan flag locks writes for 10 min until the next
 * acquire steals it. That's the trade for not running a background
 * sweeper that could itself crash.

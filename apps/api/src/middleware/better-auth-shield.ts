/**
 * Better Auth organization-plugin shield.
 *
 * Better Auth's organization plugin exposes a handful of GET endpoints
 * inside its catch-all that leak member / invitation data to ANY
 * authenticated org member — including "restricted" users who, by our
 * permission model, should not see admin-tier directory data:
 *
 *   GET /api/auth/organization/list-members
 *   GET /api/auth/organization/list-invitations
 *   GET /api/auth/organization/get-active-member-role  (with ?userId=)
 *
 * We can't patch the plugin handler, so this middleware sits in front
 * of /api/auth/* and intercepts these specific paths.
 *
 *  - restricted             → 403 on all three (admin-tier reads)
 *  - member                 → may list teammates (already in the org),
 *                             but NOT invitations or other users' roles
 *  - admin / owner          → pass through to Better Auth
 *  - anything else / no session → pass through, Better Auth handles 401
 *
 * Failure-safe: if anything throws while reading the session or the
 * caller's membership, we fall through and let Better Auth respond.
 * We never confirm cross-tenant existence in the error path.
